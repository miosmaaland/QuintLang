# QuintLang

Authors : Mio Sm√•land and Trym Sandvik


In this Bachelor thesis we have been exploring the capabilities of the Quint specification language, and translated a bit of the Hotstuff algorithm from TLA+ to Quint. 

To run some tests with the repl, use  " quint -r hotstuff.qnt::BlockChain"
To see the spec in different states, you can run "quint run Moreira.qnt", to see how the different actions work.

Note : Moreira.qnt is made by Gabriela Moreira, research engineer in Informal Systems.

Hotstuff.tla is made by our supervisor Leander Jehl, and is to be found in his github repository : https://github.com/leandernikolaus/hotstuff-ivy
